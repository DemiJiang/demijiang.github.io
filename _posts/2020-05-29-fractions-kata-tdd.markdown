Today I signed off my fractions TDD course. 
The course is showing an approach how to do TDD. I have been struggling on how to do TDD then my friend gave 
me a course with me.

The first section is about fractions kata. Before coding, the course showed to write a list of tests which drives 
the implementation which is really helpful. 
It also taught me using GCD algorithm to complete the kata.

I have committed the code in my github, pls find in here

A wise man told me that "The thing is you have do want it. And wanting it not doing it, well then
you'll get no where. It won't come easy and it will require hard work" I note it down. Thanks for the guidance as always 

Happy Coding!
