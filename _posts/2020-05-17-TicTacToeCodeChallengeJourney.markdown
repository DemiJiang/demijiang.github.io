Today I worked to refactor my Tic Tac Toe

I am working on a development program, from basic coding to more advanced code challenges. One of the code challenges
is Tic Tac Toe. I started from TDD which I found it is not easy for because I am not familiar with the language.
Then I switched my mindset to get it working. Today it is almost my eighth version of Tic Tac Toe. I am refactoring it
to make it better.

Happy Sunday!
